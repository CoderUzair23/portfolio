## About Me

I am a passionate web developer with a keen interest in front-end technologies. I specialize in creating **responsive** and **interactive** websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I strive to write clean, efficient code while focusing on the user experience and design.

## Technologies Used

This portfolio website is built with the following technologies:

- **HTML5**: The structure and content of the website.
- **CSS3**: Styling, layout, and responsiveness to ensure the site looks great on all devices.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive features and dynamic content, including event handling and user input validation.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes JavaScript-driven features like animations, form validation, and smooth scrolling.
- **Project Gallery**: Showcases the projects I have worked on with details and links to live demos and GitHub repositories.
- **Contact Form**: A form to get in touch with me for freelance or collaboration opportunities.

## Getting Started

To view the website locally or contribute to the project, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
